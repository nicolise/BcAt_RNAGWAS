Using a
negative binomial generalized linear model (nbGLM), we tested for significance of all factors on
each Arabidopsis transcript and obtained the proportion of variation (h2) due to the pathogen
genotypes and plant mutants, least square means (log2), and standard error for transcript
abundance (Table 2, Supplemental Data Sets 5, 6, and 7).

Supplemental Data Set 5. Model adjusted means for all transcripts measured in all genotypes of
this study.
Supplemental Data Set 6. Standard error for all transcripts measured in all genotypes of this
study.
Supplemental Data Set 7. Transcriptomic analysis of significance and heritability.

The linear model was conducted on normalized
gene counts using function glm.nb() from the “MASS” package (Venables and Ripley, 2002).
Model-corrected means and standard errors for camalexin, lesion area, and each transcript within
each isolate was determined using the “lsmeans” V2.19 package (Lenth, 2016). Raw p-values for
the F- and ChiSq-test were determined by Type II sums of squares using function anova() from
the “car” package (Fox and Weisberg, 2011). Transcript p-values were false discovery rate
(FDR) (p-value < 0.05) corrected for multiple tests of significance (Benjamini et al., 2001;
Strimmer, 2008). Broad-sense heritability of each phenotype and transcripts as the proportion of
variance attributed to B. cinerea genotype, Arabidopsis genotype, or their interaction effect to the
28
total variance within the model were estimated. We then compared broad-sense heritability of
transcripts involved in the camalexin, tryptophan, JA, and SA biosynthesis pathways in each
Arabidopsis genotype. The violin plots were generated to depict the distribution of heritability
using the “vioplot” package (Hintze, 1998).
