lsm_bigRR_MAF20_012218.csv ran expression profiles "Bcin01g00040.1" to "Bcin01g01770.1"
	aka column 2 to 919 in Phenos
lsm_bigRR_MAF20_012218_b.csv is Bcin01g01780.1 to Bcin01g09180.1
	aka column 920 to 1420 in Phenos
lsm_bigRR_MAF20.1.csv is Bcin04g03670.1 to Bcin05g05780.1
	aka column 2840 to 3340 in Phenos
lsm_bigRR_MAF20.2.csv is Bcin05g05780.1 to Bcin06g04900.1
	aka column 3340 to 3720 in Phenos

To Do: Column 1421 to 2839, 3721 to 9268 in Phenos
	aka column 1420:2838, 3720:9267 in dat
And: ran Bcin05g05780.1 (column 3340) twice

RAN THIS BUT DROPPED ALL OUTPUTS: (accidentally appended files, made a HUGE dataframe of outputs)
lsm_allphenos_MAF20_012618.1.log is "Bcin01g09200.1" to "Bcin02g03400.1"
	aka column X to X in Phenos

Running with separate output file for each phenotype:

Started  "2018-01-29 13:47:28 PST"
quit "2018-01-29 16:09:27 PST" on phenotype "Bcin03g06050.1"
Error in solve.default(C) : 
  system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 3.31769e-31
Error in Pheno.HEM.result$u : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
So, skipping this phenotype.

lsm_allphenos_MAF20_012918.1.log is Bcin01g09200.1 to Bcin02g05630.1
	aka column X to X in Phenos
	time 2018-01-29 13:47:28 PST to  2018-01-29 14:58:14 PST

lsm_allphenos_MAF20_012918.2.log is Bcin02g05630.1 to Bcin03g05600.1
	aka column X to X in Phenos
	time  2018-01-29 14:58:23 PST to 2018-01-29 16:05:57 PST 

lsm_allphenos_MAF20_012918.3.log is Bcin03g05600.1 to  Bcin03g06050.1
	aka column X to X in Phenos
	time 2018-01-29 16:06:06 PST to 2018-01-29 16:09:27 PST

So ran 1421:2445

Still need to run dat (Phenos -1) 2445:2838,3720:9267

Running again:
lsm_bigRR_MAF20_013018...csv
started 2018-01-30 12:36:33 PST
Now: started at 7 seconds per phenotype. By ~2000 (set 4 / 11), about 9 seconds per phenotype. Not bad.
Let’s say 10 seconds per phenotype, 6k phenotypes left = 60k seconds = 1000 mins = 16.7 hours GREAT!
Estimated completion time = 01/31, 04:36 AM
Took 8 seconds per phenotype by set 6 / 11
BUT quit at 2018-01-30 19:19:30 PST due to failed genotype below:
