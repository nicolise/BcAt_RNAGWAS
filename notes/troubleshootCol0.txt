Troubleshooting Col-0 lesion GEMMA

Issue: all p-values from ~ p=0.6 to p=0.99 are somehow missing/ in the lower p-value range

- tested importing Col-0 file directly to plot: no fix
- tested plotting all 3 p-value formats: no fix
- tested plotting beta alone: also very weird, has beta = 0 and then missing beta between ~abs(0 to 0.005)

- MANY SNPs with semi-small beta and consistent p-values. Removed those in R and found only ~10% SNPs remaining and minimum p-value > 0.03. Considering this a failed run

- other phenos: 236154 analyzed SNPs/var. col0: 237095 analyzed SNPs/var. 
- other phenos: 96 individuals analyzed. col0: 97 individuals analyzed.

- to do: can I identify and drop those "problematic" ~1000 SNPs and individual?

- to do: rerun in GEMMA without k-matrix and with kmat2
- to do: z-scale lesion size Col-0 and rerun in GEMMA
- to do: check for GEMMA error messages in run
- to do: try forcing longer time on optimization?
